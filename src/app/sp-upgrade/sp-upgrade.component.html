            <p class="sp-upgrade-text">
                You can obtain 20x Dragon Card Protection Scrolls after completing an Act4 raid. <br>
                The new material is Dragon Gem. You can craft them with Blood-Red Rubies at Dragon Gem 
                NPC in Act4 Citadel (1x Blood-Red Ruby gives 5x Dragon Gems).

            <p class="sp-upgrade-text">
                After upgrading a SP +20, while attacking you have 5% chance to activate the <b>Dragon Blessing</b>
                which is basically a "stronger" Onyx effect. <br> 
                To this Dragon Blessing you can add an additional buff. In order to add a buff, you need to 
                craft an <b>Elemental Gemstone</b> at Elemental Gemstones NPC in Act4 Citadel. The buff they give 
                are activated when the Dragon Blessing appears.
