            <p class="feature-info">
                The FPS Unlock feature allows you to "unlock" the Nostale frame rate, increasing it to 
                above the default of 60 FPS which may reduce the input lag and allow players to make the 
                most out of monitors with a 60hz+ refresh rate which will make NosTale so much more enjoyable
                for players!
